# Pandas Weirdness of the week

A collection of Weird behaviour encountered when using Pandas.

Weird behaviour has a fuzzy definition. In some cases the behaviour is a bug. In other cases it is correct but unexpected behaviour. 
In most cases not understanding or expecting the behaviour will leads to bugs in Pandas users' code. This repo documents the strange behaviour found in the hope that once documented these bugs can be avoided     

*Pull requests most welcome!*
